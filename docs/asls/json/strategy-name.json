    "AtnBrickStorageHeater": "Publicly available Dijkstra-based AtomicTNode strategy for a brick storage heater. These heaters are rooom units that store heat in a brick core, are heated with resistive elements, and typically have a fan to blow air over the brick core. They are sometimes called Electric Thermal Storage (ETS) heaters, and in the UK are often called Economy 7 heaters or Night Storage Heaters. A strategy very similar to this was used by VCharge to manage an ETS fleet of several thousand heaters in Pennsylvania. This strategy is meant to serve as a template for other private strategies, and also allows for an end-to-end simulation of a realistic aggregated transactive load capable of generating a highly elastic bid curve [More Info](https://gridworks-atn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/brick-storage-heater.html)"
